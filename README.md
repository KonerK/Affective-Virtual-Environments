# Creating Four Affective Virtual Environments in VR
This project describes the work undertaken in my dissertation, which focused on creating four affective environments each designed to induce a specific emotion. The Unity environments developed during this project, in collaboration with another student from the University of Bath.

## Project Overview
Virtual reality (VR) has been shown to elicit intense emotion in users. However, due to the relative novelty of the technology, developers are still unsure how to best design virtual environments (VEs) to maximize emotional engagement and intensity. This project aimed to identify specific design choices that can evoke four different target emotions in VR: happiness, calmness, sadness, and fear. A second goal was to achieve this with minimal variation between the VEs, ensuring usabilitity for academic research, where it is essential to minimize confounding variables. With this in mind, we designed each VE to be as similar as possible, systematically altering specific elements in each, such as lighting, to influence user emotion. 

## Results & Analysis
Overall, the four following virtual environments were developed. we manipulated sound design, lighting, color scheme, and environmental objects, such as flowers, and trees, within the same realistic bedroom VE. For instance, the VE designed to elicit fear was filled with bloodied handprints and stains across the room. It was also very dark, and the sound of a floor creaking could be heard in the background.

After creating each VE, 20 participants experienced each VE for 1 minute 30 seconds, after which they self-reported their levels of ten different emotions by answering direct questions on QuestionPro, such as 'How excited did you feel?', rated on a scale of 0-10. Box plots and scatter plots were then used to: 
1) Compare affective ratings between each VE for the four emotions designed to be induced (e.g., comparing happiness ratings across all four VEs), shown using scatter plots.
2) Compare affective ratings within each VE for all possible emotions, shown using box plots.

In each case, a repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze the effect of the VE on participants' self-reported affective ratings. The plots used in this analysis are shown below. You will also note the measures of arousal and valence, where arousal refers to the intensity of the emotion felt, and valence refers to the positivity of this emotion

From these results, it was clear that each VE successfully elicited its target emotion at intense levels, but these emotions were not distinct within each environment. We explore this more thoroughly in the dissertation, but this likely due to the fact that emotions can often co-occur. That is, it may be quite difficult to feel very calm without also feeling happy. We also look at ways in which we could further evoke the different emotions in each VE. We suggest future directions to developers on how to design virtual environments to best elicit desired emotions based on these results.

## Conclusions & Future Work
From these results, it was clear that each VE successfully elicited its target emotion at intense levels, but these emotions were not distinct within each environment. We explore this more thoroughly in the dissertation, but this likely due to the fact that emotions can often co-occur. That is, it may be quite difficult to feel very calm without also feeling happy. We also look at ways in which we could further evoke the different emotions in each VE. We suggest future directions to developers on how to design virtual environments to best elicit desired emotions based on these results.

Not mentioned previously was a separate goal of this dissertation, which was that these environments were built with the intent to use them in the study of embodiment in VR.  The sense of embodiment broadly refers to the senses that help us feel ownership over our body. It has been shown that we can actually feel a sense of embodiment towards external objects, such as our avatars in VR. However, little is known about the interplay between emotion and embodiment, and as such, this work was developed so that future studies can explore this relationship thoroughly in a controlled, systematic manner.
